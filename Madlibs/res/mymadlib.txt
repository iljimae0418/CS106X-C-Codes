Hi! I am professor <name>!
Today I am going to talk about <noun>. Suppose that
we are statistical consultants hired by a client to provide
advice on how to improve sales of a particular <food>.

The advertising data set consists of the sales of that product in <number>
different markets, along with advertising budgets for the product in each
of those markets for three different media: <noun>, <noun>, <noun>. Our client
may control the <noun> expenditure in each of the three media. Therefore, if we
determine that there is an association between <noun> and <noun>, then we can
instruct our client to adjust advertising budgets, therby indirectly <verb>
sales.
